# R and RStudio

**Instructor:** Erin Osborne Nishimura, PhD

**Dates:** Monday January 29, 2024 & Wednesday January 31, 2024

## Introduction to Quantitative Cell and Molecular Biology! - R & R Studio Module

In this first module, we will explore the basics of **R**. What is R? 
  * R is a programming language, a coding environment, and a whole community. 
  * The goal of this module is __not__ to master R. That will take time. 
  * Here, we will just get to know a few basics of interfacing with and using R. 
  * Many people in this class are already familiar with R. There will be additional content for you. 

## Introductions

  * My background & my journey. How did I get here?
    * Full disclaimer - I do not have a computer science background
  

## Learning objectives for this module

  * Let's **start fresh** with coding
  * Students will learn how and why R is **useful in biological research**
  * Students will learn how to **interface** with R and RStudio
  * Students will become familiar with a few basic **R objects** or extend their knowledge into new objects
  * Students will execute a few basic **R functions** or extend their knowledge into new functions
  
## Where will you go in the next modules?
  * **Next:** Students will learn to **import and export** data
  * **Next:** Students will learn to extend functionality of R by loading **packages**
  * **Next:** Students will gain experience in basic **plotting**

## Let's **start fresh** with coding

//Who is a programmer? Who is a coder? Who is a computational biologist? Who is a bioinformatician? Who is a "geek"? What do these terms mean?//

  * How have your past **experiences** in mathematics, coding, or quantitation shaped your notions of it? 
  * How have your past experiences influenced whether you think you are **good at** it?
  * How have your past experiences influenced whether you think you **enjoy** it?
  * What about the **stories** we absorb and hear? How do these influence whether we feel like this is "our thing" or not?
