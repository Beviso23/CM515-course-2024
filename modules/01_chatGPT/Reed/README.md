## Learning Objectives

In this lecture, you will learn how to use ChatGPT to interpret, document, and fix R code. The scenario involves inheriting a broken R script from a previous grad student. As a beginner in R, your task is to take on a project with multiple advanced steps and a script that appears to be malfunctioning. The script is designed to read in data and produce plots. The specific tasks you'll cover include:

1. Reading in the script and explaining its functionality.
2. Documenting the code using ChatGPT to generate descriptive comments.
3. Attempting to fix the code with assistance from ChatGPT.
4. Utilizing ChatGPT to explain the plots generated by the script.

## Exercise Files

### R Script: CM515-ChatGPT-R-Exercise1-Undocumented-Broken.R

This R script is provided for the exercise. It is expected to read in data from two files and generate plots. However, the script is broken, and your task is to understand its original purpose.

### Metadata File: Metadata_Exercise1.csv

This file contains two examples of metadata obtained from a longitudinal study of broiler chickens. It is used as input data for the R script.

### Gene Presence Absence File: Gene_data_Exercise1.csv

This file contains presence-absence data for various antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. It is another input file required by the R script.

## Exercise Steps

### Step 1: Understanding the Script

Open the R script (`CM515-ChatGPT-R-Exercise1-Undocumented-Broken.R`) and use ChatGPT to help you understand its functionality.

### Step 2: Documenting the Code

Modify your prompt to ChatGPT in a way that generates descriptive comments for the code. Add comments to clarify the purpose of different sections.

### Step 3: Attempting to Fix the Code

Seek assistance from ChatGPT to identify and fix issues in the script. Modify your prompt to address specific problems.

### Step 4: Explaining the Plots

Once the script is fixed and executed successfully, use ChatGPT to generate explanations for the plots generated by the script.

This exercise provides hands-on experience in leveraging ChatGPT for code understanding, documentation, debugging, and interpretation of results.
