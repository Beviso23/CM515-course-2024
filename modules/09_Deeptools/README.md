# Module 9 Deeptools analysis 

## Introduction

Deeptools is for visualizing, analyzing DNA-seq next generation sequencing (ngs) experiments.

Requires High Performance Computing (HPC), which requires linux.

Required too much background, practice. ***BUT*** I got *bash jupyter notebooks* working. 

Allows us to work on linux, learning analysis, using command line and bash inside of **code cells**, like code chunks in RMarkdown.

Drawback - not hands on learning of bash/command line
- take DSCI510 (Linux as a computational platform) in the fall.
- DSCI512 (RNA-seq analysis) for more experience.
- use CMB code club for materials/tutorials
    - we're planning on some regular workshop-style topics in the summer
    - may ask help adapting material

## What we're doing this week

- Monday
    - 1st hour - David: 
        - Overview of HPC, getting started on Alpine Web Interface
        - Run setup code on Alpine using Jupyter BASH notebooks 
        - Troubleshoot if necessary
    - 2nd hour - Sarah Swygert:
        - Overview of ChIP-based methods
- Wednesday
    - Sarah Swygert: Deeptools analysis and Exercises
